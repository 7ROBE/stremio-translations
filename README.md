# stremio-translations

**This is the repository the [Stremio media center](http://www.strem.io) uses for all translation strings.**

Any help with contributing additional translations would be extremely helpful! For contributing, use en_US as a starting point because it's always guaranteed to include all the translation strings. Thank you!

Top priority translations:

* pt_BR
* pt_PT
* fr_FR


**The ability to use those translations will be out in Stremio 3.4.0, scheduled Monday or Tuesday**
