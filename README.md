# stremio-translations

**This is the repository the [Stremio media center](http://www.strem.io) uses for all translation strings.**

### How to contribute

Any help with contributing additional translations would be extremely helpful!
For contributing, use en_US as a starting point because it's always guaranteed to include all the translation strings.
Thank you!

### How to test in the app

Clone this repo, copy en-US.json as a starting point into your language's locale file, following IETF standard. To test in the app, start Stremio like:
